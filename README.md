# Executive Summary

  From an analysis of Amazon web service products via MySQL and Power BI, specific variables surrounding billing periods, total cost, and usage quantity concluded Amazon RDS Service averaged the largest cost despite correlating to some of the lowest total transactions. Compared to AWS Data Transfer, which occupies the majority of transactions but also one of the lowest on average costs, increasing sale frequency for higher revenue generating services, or reviewing cost on more frequently used services, could potentially increasing overall earnings.

## Problem

maximizing earning potential via demand of products is a consistant business need across all industries. Through an analysis of product demand compared to average sales, advertising can be targeted towards more favorable products along with an evaluation on profit margin and average earnings to greater understand client need and cost potential. The Amazon Web Services data set was targeted towards understanding product lines offered online via Amazon and to determine sale potential.

## Methodology

The data set was initially analyzed in MySQL to subdivide the data into smaller relations surrounding variables including billing, usage, cost, and product line. Additional coding was then utilized towards understanding general trends and associations in products, cost, and usage. Through Power BI, insights could then be better visualized to demonstrate trends and relations within the data set. 

## Skills

1. MySQL
2. Power BI
3. Data Visualization/Dashboarding
4. Product information and Sales Data

## Results and Recommendations

The analysis of average cost to product and usage concluded no correlation between quantity and cost but did conclude that Amazon RDS Service average the largest cost at $243.47 despite only making up 7% of sales as shown in Figure 1 below. The most frequent selling product was associated with AWS Data Transfer at 51.2% of total sales although the average cost was $1.97. Amazon Simple Queue Service and Amazon Simple Notification Service also were associated with $0.00 cost. From this information gathered, better understanding of product lines would aid in determining why certain services yield no profit although this could be associated with free products to aid in customer satisfaction. Marketing work would serve to increase the higher earning products, such as Amazon RDS Service, to increase total transactions and revenue while a review of earning potential could be conducted on AWS Data Transfer to better maximize profits for this widely used product.

## Next Steps

Future work would benefit from additional data collection and analysis on profit margins along with customer demands specifically towards aiding in stronger, more educated decisions, surrounding marketing on both high demand product lines and highly lucrative products along with products that don't yield any profit but could aid in the sales of other provided services.
